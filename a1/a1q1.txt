B00673126 Liam Gowan Assignment 1 Question 1

(i)
When entering text from the keyboard, the end of input can be signalled by
entering the command ^D (control D), which tells UNIX that it's reached the
End Of File, which means that no more data can be read from a file or stream.

(ii)
The permissions of a file can be represented in 9 bits, an octogal number of 3 
digits, or a 3 digit number where each digit refers to what each of 3 digit sets
of the octogal number would be in the decimal system. The 3 digit number 666
is equivalent to 110110110. The first 3 number set refers to the permissions for 
the owner, the second 3 number set refers to the permissions of a group, and the 
third 3 number set refers to the permissions of others. In each number set, the 
first digit is the read value, the second digit is the write value, and the 
third digit is the execute value. In this case, the execute value is set to false
for each number set. This means that a user cannot access the files in the directory.
In order to modify the permissions of csci2132 such that the directory can be accessed,
"chmod 777 csci2132" must be entered by the user.
