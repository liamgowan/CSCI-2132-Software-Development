i) The ">" will overwrite the given file with the input, while the ">>" will 
append the input to the given file. 
For example, if ex.txt contained the following three lines:
Hello world!
It sure is amazing
What you you can do with UNIX.

And ex2.txt contained the following line:
Hi World!

And the command: cat ex.txt > ex2.txt
Was entered, then cat ex2.txt would display only:
Hello world!
It sure is amazing
What you can do with UNIX.

However if the command: cat ex.txt >> ex2.txt 
was entered (assuming both are still original files), this would be the
result of cat ex2.txt:

Hello world! It sure is amazing
What you can do with UNIX.
Hi World!

ii) The commands "grep" and "/bin/grep" work the same because the shell will
search through all of the directories stored in available PATH variable. If it
exists, it will attempt to execute it, and if it does not execute an error 
message will be displayed.
